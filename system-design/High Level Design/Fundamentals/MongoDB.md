# MongoDB

RDBMS	             MongoDB
Table	            Collection
Column	            Key
Value	            Value
Records / Rows	    Document / Object

A collection may store a number of documents. A collection is analogous to a table of an RDBMS.

A collection may store documents those who are not same in structure. 
This is possible because MongoDB is a Schema-free database. In a relational database like MySQL, 
a schema defines the organization / structure of data in a database. 
MongoDB does not require such a set of formula defining structure of data.
So, it is quite possible to store documents of varying structures in a collection.
Practically, you don't need to define a column and it's datatype unlike in RDBMS, while working with MongoDB.
