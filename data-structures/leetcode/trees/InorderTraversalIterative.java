//Algorithm
//Initialize an empty stack.
//
//Push the current node (starting from the root node) onto the stack. Continue pushing nodes to the left of the current node until a NULL value is reached.
//
//If the current node is NULL and the stack is not empty:
//
//Remove and print the last item from the stack.
//Set the current node to be the node to the right of the removed node.
//Repeat the second step of the algorithm.
//If the current node is NULL â€‹and the stack is empty, then the algorithm has finished.
