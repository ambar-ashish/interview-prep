Consistent Hashing:
A type of hashing that minimizes the number of keys that needs to be remapped when a hash table gets resized.
Its often used by load balancers to ditribute traffic to servers; it minimizes the number of requests that get forwarded
to different servers when new servers are added or when existing servers are brought down.

SHA: Secure Hash algorithms
